# Interview cracker

This repo contains my solutions to interview questions published on Leetcode.com discussion forum. 

The solutions are written in Java or Kotlin. Choice of language depends if it is easier to solve the problem in one of them.

The repo is organized by companies. In every company's directory you will find a README file with information about which questions are solved and how. The questions are screenshotted from Leetcode service since some of them are removed after a while.

Current list of companies covered:
* [Atlassian](./src/main/java/com/piotrkafel/atlassian)
* [Databricks](./src/main/java/com/piotrkafel/databricks)
* [JP Morgan](./src/main/java/com/piotrkafel/jpmorgan)
* [Stripe](./src/main/java/com/piotrkafel/stripe)

More to come!
